# Infinite Scroll

A minimal demo of how to implement an infinite scrolling view in Next.js using React Query.

For reference, I used [@joschan21's](https://github.com/joschan21) implementation in [breadit](https://github.com/joschan21/breadit).

This will serve as a reference for me (and others) whenever I need to reimplement something like this in the future.
